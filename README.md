# RePEc-Twitter users similarity

This [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app allows you to find your
most similar economist(s) on Twitter. It works for people registered
as economist on [RePEc](http://repec.org) and the similarity is
calculated by considering the JEL or NEP fields of authors' works.

You can play with it at https://io.mongeau.net/repec-twitter-simil/

If you want to run the app locally, you'll need a database saved in a
`db.rds` file. I'm not sharing it publicly (yet?), but you can contact
me and I will send it to you.
